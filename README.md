A simple bank account program written in Ruby using
Test Driven Development and based on the following user stories:

* As a customer,
  so that I can keep my money safe,
  I would like to deposit money in my account.
* As a customer,
  so that I can spend my money,
  I would like to withdraw money from my account.
* As a customer,
  so that I can budget,
  I would like to view my balance.

I have also added a feature to prevent the customer from being able
to withdraw any money when their balance is Â£0.
